# Configuration Steps
## Configure AMP
Before the plugin can be used you need to configure AMP in a specific way.  **NOTE: The plugin cannot be used on ADS. It can only run on non-ADS instances.**
### Activate with a Developer Licence
* Request a developer licence from AMP via the licence portal https://manage.cubecoders.com/Login
* Once you have received the licence log into your server console and as the amp user run `ampinstmgr stop [ADS INSTANCE NAME]` followed by `ampinstmgr reactivate [INSTANCE NAME] [DEVELOPER KEY]`  where `[INSTANCE NAME]` is the name of your instance you want to set up a bot for and `[DEVELOPER KEY]` is the key received from CubeCoders.
* Start your ADS instance again with `ampinstmgr start [ADS INSTANCE NAME]`.

### Installing and Enabling the Plugin
* Edit the AMPConfig.conf file in the root folder of your instance (e.g. `/home/amp/.ampdata/instances/INSTANCENAME01/AMPConfig.conf`)
* Under AMP.LoadPlugins add `DiscordBotPlugin` to the list (e.g. `AMP.LoadPlugins=["FileManagerPlugin","EmailSenderPlugin","WebRequestPlugin","LocalFileBackupPlugin","CommonCorePlugin","DiscordBotPlugin"]`)
* In the plugins folder for your instance (e.g. `/home/amp/.ampdata/instances/INSTANCENAME01/Plugins/`) create a new folder called `DiscordBotPlugin` and insert the .dll file from the current [release](https://github.com/winglessraven/AMP-Discord-Bot/releases/latest "release")
* Restart your instance with `ampinstmgr restart [INSTANCE NAME]`
* Log in to your instance and you will see a new menu item under Configuration for the Discord Bot

## Configure your Discord Bot
### Create the Application
* Log in to https://discord.com/developers/applications with your Discord account.
* Click `New Application`
* Enter a name for your application and click `Create`

### Create the Bot
* Click `Bot` on the menu bar along the left, then click `Add Bot`
* Give your bot an icon and enable `Server Members Intent` â€“ this is to ensure that cached member groups are not used if using permissions for controlling servers (start/stop/update/restart/kill)
* Save your changes
* Copy your bot token and paste it in the token field of the Discord Bot menu in AMP

### Configure Permissions and Add to your Discord Server
* Click the `OAuth2` option on the left hand menu followed by `URL Generator`
* Select `bot` and `applications.commands` followed by `Send Messages`,`Manage Messages`,`Embed Links`,`Read Message History`, and `Add Reactions`
* Copy the resulting URL and paste into a new browser tab
* Log in if nedded and add the bot to your Discord server by selecting it in the list
* If you plan to use pemissions for the server commands, create a new role on your Discord server to use later on.
